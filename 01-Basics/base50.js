/**
 * It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. 
 * When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
 * 
 * In this example:
 * var someVar = "Hat";
 * function myFun() {
 *   var someVar = "Head";
 *   return someVar;
 * }

 The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.
 
 Add a local variable to myOutfit function to override the value of outerWear with "sweater".
